                whites are firm and the yolk is still slightly runny.</li>
            <li>While the egg cooks, toast two slices of bread of your choice until golden and crispy. If you prefer,

            <li>When the egg is ready, carefully place it onto one of the toasted bread slices. You can season the egg
                with salt and pepper if desired, to enhance the flavor.</li>
            <li>Cover the egg with the second toasted bread slice, forming a sandwich. Now you have a delicious egg
                sandwich ready to be enjoyed!</li>
